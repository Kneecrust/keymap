# Keymap
Adapting [@callum-oakley/keymap](https://github.com/callum-oakley/keymap) & BrokenFlows [@BrokenFlows/keymap](https://github.com/BrokenFlows/keymap) to suit my own keyboard in the making.

Here is my current keymap.
In order you see:
1. Base
2. Base SHIFT
3. All Home Mods
4. Outer Combo's
5. Inner Combo's 
6. Numbers
7. Symbols
8. Function Keys
9. Navigation
---

Legend:
- Keys joined by a short arc are combos, accessed by pressing both keys at once
- Red keys are held to access layers or modifiers
